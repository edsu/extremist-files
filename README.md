The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org) have done
extensive work to document hate groups and extremists as part of their
[Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) 
website.

In order to make this list a bit more useful in social media research
this repository collects the data from their website and makes it available
as JSON and CSV data.

We're trying to crowd source the Twitter, Facebook and Website URLs over
in this Google Sheet.
