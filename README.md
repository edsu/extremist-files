The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org) have done
extensive work to document hate groups and extremists as part of their
[Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) 
website.

In order to make this list a bit more useful in social media research
we thought it would be useful to gather twitter handles and website
urls for these individuals and organizations.
