The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org) have done
extensive work to document hate groups and extremists as part of their
[Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) 
and [Hate Map](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map) websites.

In order to make this list a bit more useful in social media research
this repository collects the data from the SPLC  website and makes it 
available as JSON and CSV data.

To run the scraper you will want to:

1. install [Python] (if you don't already have it)
2. install [pip] (note: it comes with Python3)
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `./crawl.py`
5. look at resulting json and csv files
