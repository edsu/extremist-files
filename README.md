The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org) have done
extensive work to document hate groups and extremists as part of their
[Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files).

In order to make this useful for  social media research this repository collects
the data from the Extremist Files and makes it available as JSON and CSV data.

To run the scraper you will want to:

1. install [Python] (if you don't already have it)
2. install [pip] (note: it comes with Python3)
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `./crawl.py`
5. brew some tea or coffee
6. look at individuals.json, groups.json and extremist-files.csv
