  <p>
  The <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>
  are doing brave work documenting known hate groups and extremists as part 
  of their <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files">Extremist Files</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map">Hate Map</a> projects.
  We are trying to identify the social media accounts and website URLs 
  for these organizations to help study the impact that they are having 
  on the Web.</p>

  <p>
  If you have good search skills and a strong stomach  please help us
  locate website, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube account URLs for these 
  organizations. One way you can triangulate them is by searching 
  first for their website to see if any social media accounts are 
  linked from there. Or you can add the social media site name to a 
  Google search for the organization name. But remember, not all 
  of these organizations will have social media accounts or even a website.
